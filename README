This was a hackathon collaboration with oahassan. It didn't work. Not enough mountain dew I guess. :-)

The idea was to create a crowd-sourced question answer service over email. You send a question to Mr. Quibbles
and in order to get a response you have to answer someone else's question. Answers are combined (again,
crowd-sourced), and then sent back to you.

We never got the number of people answering questions right, so most people never got an answer. We tested
the demo gods and they were angry. Watch the video starting at 16:30
